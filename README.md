# Business Data Visualization with Tableau

I have employed Tableau for data visualization and analysis of the business performance concerning profits, sales, shipping, and discounts amidst the impact of COVID-19. The extensive dataset, containing over 50,000 rows, has been visualized to provide valuable insights into various aspects of the business. Profits and sales have slowed down, with some countries and segments showing potential for reassessment. Shipping has room for improvement, and a closer analysis of discounts is necessary to maximize profits. The business successfully manages its product offerings, making prompt decisions to remove underperforming items. Tableau effectively visualizes the large dataset, enabling data-driven decision-making and also making it easy for stockholders to digest the information. The full report is also available in the github files.

**Key Insights:**

1. Sales and profits have been affected by COVID-19, but the business remains afloat.
2. Shipping performance can be optimized by reducing shipping times and exploring cost-effective options.
3. Discounts require careful analysis to strike a balance between maximizing profits and driving sales.
4. Product management and advertising should focus on high-margin items, such as phones and copiers.

**Recommendations:**

1. Adapt sales strategies to the current global situation, promoting home-based products.
2. Investigate loss-making countries and either address issues or cease operations in those regions.
3. Improve shipping timeframes and costs, and consider offering "free shipping" to boost sales.
4. Analyze and optimize discount strategies, focusing on the right products and targeting returning customers.
